# Sidpatchy's Discord Bot Tools
Various useful tools developed by Sidpatchy for Discord bot testing and management.

Currently includes:
* serverTest - checks how many servers the bot is in. Can be activated by issuing the command ?servs
* printMessage - prints a message in the console, there isn't really a purpose for this.
